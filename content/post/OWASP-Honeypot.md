So, last night I got an email from a blackhat's staff who reminded me it's the last day to submit my presentation for Blackhat Arsenal Asia 2020, I recorded a very short video to demonstrate how [OWASP Python Honeypot](https://github.com/zdresearch/OWASP-Honeypot) works, the timing tight and short but kind of perfect because we just finished the Google summer of code 2020 period and two of my students [Dhiren Devinder Serai](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6164349967663104) and [Chakshu Gupta](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4558542343766016) had done many great contributions. I thought the vide worth the sharing, also it's saving me time to write, so I would like to say no more! Watch the video, and send you feedback.
