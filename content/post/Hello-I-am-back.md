WTH,

After a couple of years, I decided to start updating the blog, I will write about different kinds of stuff, this post literally is just to test the theme has no other purpose, I might delete it after I'm done, or just leave it here, don't know, don't care. Anyway, I used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Hugo.386](https://gitlab.com/maxlefou/hugo.386) with a little bit of modification to create my website, and I replaced the font with `AcPlus_IBM_EGA_9x14` (reference: [int10h.org](https://int10h.org/)) and hosted on GitHub ([source](https://github.com/Ali-Razmjoo/Ali-Razmjoo.github.io/tree/master), [public](https://github.com/Ali-Razmjoo/Ali-Razmjoo.github.io/tree/gh-pages)) and used [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for CDN and caching. I think my first actual post will be introducing one of my opensource tool [OWASP-Honeypot](https://github.com/zdresearch/OWASP-Honeypot) `Automated Honeypot/Deception Framework`, and then get into development framework and details.


Frid ut!!
